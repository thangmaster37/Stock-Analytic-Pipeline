# Stock-Market-Analysis

This a project of Stock Market Analysis And Forecasting Using Deep Learning(pytorch,gru).

A stock market, equity market, or share market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers of stocks (also called shares), which represent ownership claims on businesses; these may include securities listed on a public stock exchange, as well as stock that is only traded privately, such as shares of private companies which are sold to investors through equity crowdfunding platforms. Investment in the stock market is most often done via stockbrokerages and electronic trading platforms. Investment is usually made with an investment strategy in mind.

Market analysis is an important tool to help investors and traders understand and make informed decisions about the stock market. It provides information and insights into the factors and fluctuations within the market, thereby helping to optimize profits and manage risks in stock trading activities.

In the first part of the project, we will try to implement data scraping. And in the second part, we do push the data to the database. And finally create a dashboard to clearly display information.
